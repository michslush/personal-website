            After earning my bachelor's degree in mathematics, I taught high
            school calculus for two years. I knew I wanted to explore other
            career paths, and then I was given the amazing opportunity to move
            to Melbourne, Australia. I worked there in sales for six months but
            became eager to learn more about programming after I was promoted to
            a role where I used Excel and several automated scheduling apps.

            I moved back to the U.S. and taught myself Python, thinking I wanted
            to learn more about data science. I moved to New York City and
            decided to pursue a career in software engineering instead. I found
            Fullstack Academy of Code's Grace Hopper Program which stood out to
            me above all other coding bootcamps in the New York area.

            Over the last six months, I've been able to hone my problem-solving
            skills in a programming environment, and I'm now familiar with the
            many layers of full-stack web development. I graduated from Grace
            Hopper in May and I recently began my current position as a teaching
            fellow at Grace Hopper in their three-month fellowship program.
            After the fellowship, I will be seeking roles in which I can be
            further challenged with interesting projects so I can grow as a
            software engineer.
